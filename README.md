# Personal config
![screenshot](./screenshot.png)
Use to management my personal configuration, If something here is helpful, You can also use any code you like from this repo.

This repo's structure just as same as your $HOME.

Some config in neovim and tmux needs to set patch font in your terminal emulator, recommand one of the [nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

NOTE: I'm a Arch Linux user, so I upgrade my system almost everyday. If something here not working well for you, you should try the nightly version, or just join Arch Linux :).

Also I had optimize this repo size recently by using [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/), so is ok that if you see commits in here have much less then before, that's ok, nothing is lost, just changed direction.

## Some directory that I really speed lot time

### .config/nvim
My neovim configuration. since neovim 0.5 version, lot plugins are not compatible with vim, so I completely separated vim and neovim configuration. 

### .config/hypr
[hypr](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) a wayland based compositor

### Note that some directory have `readme.md`, That's some special operations and memos I recorded, the `/project/my/config` path in each readme file must be replace with your own path
